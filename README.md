# My solution for exercises of the course Lab Network at Aalto University

In this course, students get to practice their knowledge in **networking**, Linux operation (I used **Ubuntu**), **Virtual machines**, **scripting**, and additional tool like **Vagrant**.

Based on the requirements of each exercise, new tools/software are installed to achieve the best result
